# Contribution guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Go Proverbs.

Please be aware that the bar for addition is very high and to add a proverb one
needs context that explains it.  The hope is that any further additions would
be distillations of arguments about how to use the language.  Those arguments
must be presented to support the nominated proverb.

Because the bar for addition is very high and difficult to specify, additions
to the list are unlikely to be accepted until there is another proverbs talk,
or maybe a book, explaining and expanding on the originals plus the additions.
